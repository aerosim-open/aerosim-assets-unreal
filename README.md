# AeroSim Unreal Asset Library

This repo contains an Unreal content-only plugin with a set of Unreal-native uassets for the AeroSim simulation. These assets are converted from the base USD versions of the [AeroSim Asset Library](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim-assets).

See the [AeroSim repo](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim) for instructions on how to install and use these assets with the sim.
